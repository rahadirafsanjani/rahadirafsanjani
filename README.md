# Hi there! 👋

I'm a developer who finds joy in the intersection of **legacy systems** and **cutting-edge technology**.

## 🔧 What I Do

Currently working on breathing new life into legacy codebases while staying excited about modern tech innovations. I specialize in:

- **Legacy Archaeology** - Understanding old codebases and documenting the "why" behind the "what"
- **Modernization** - Introducing modern practices without breaking everything
- **Bridging Eras** - Making legacy systems talk to modern APIs and services

## 💡 Philosophy

> "Legacy code isn't technical debt—it's evidence of problems we've already solved."

The best solutions combine time-tested patterns with modern capabilities. Refactoring is an art form.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Legacy:** Java, PHP, .NET, classic databases, reverse engineering undocumented systems  
**Modern:** New frameworks, CI/CD, cloud architecture, containerization, AI tools

## 🌱 Current Interests

Testing untested legacy code • AI-assisted code understanding • Observability in old and new systems
